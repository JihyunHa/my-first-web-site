    <p>When the summer moon is full, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Vampirina-Beach-Anne-Marie-Pace/dp/148477342X" target="_blank" title="Buy this book">a beach trip</a> is an epic way to spend the night.</p>
    <p>Kick off the evening by helping to unpack the car. You'll want a cooler full of yummy drinks and snacks to stave off hunger.
        <br>Don't forget the sunscreen! Stake out your home base with a colorful beach blanket and an umbrella. Near a lifeguard stand is best.</p>
    <p>There's a lot to do at the beach, but you've got all night for fun! Just pick anything and dive right in. 
        <br>In the ocean, always stay with a buddy or two, and only swim where the lifeguards can see you.</p>
    <p>Playing in the waves can be a lot of fun. Hop over low waves, and dive through the high ones... but never turn your back to the sea!</p>
    <p>When the waves are breaking just right, give surfing a whirl. Practice your best ballet posture: catch a wave, demi-plie, and ride, ride, RIDE!</p>
    <p>You'll quickly learn that wiping out is part of the game. As Madame always says, "Chin up!" It's hart to be the best at something new.</p>
    <p>Learning to snorkel might be easier than learning to surf, but you still have to concentrate. Just remember to breathe through your mouth and not your nose. 
        <br>Once you're feeling comfortable in the water, you'll discover all the hidden treasures of the ocean!</p>
    <p>When you've had enough of the water, ask your fellow beachgoers if you can join their volleyball game. Remember that volleyball is like dancing. 
        <br>You must leap high, stay light on your toes, and always hit your mark.</p>
    <p>After the game, try your hand at a giant sand castle. You'll need a big shovel and bucket, a pile of wet sand... a bit of patience... and a lot of ingenuity! 
        <br>Just don't build too close to the water! If the sand castle doesn't work out, don't worry. The night isn't over yet...</p>
    <p>Get stocked for a masive midnight dance contest! It doesn't matter if it's Swan Lake on a stage or the twist in the sand- dancing with friends is fun that never stops. 
        <br>Whether or not you come out on top, finishing with grace is what makes you a real winner.</p>
    <p>As the night draws to an end, sit around a roaring fire. Roast marshmallows and hot dogs. Sing some old songs and make plans for an encore!</p>
