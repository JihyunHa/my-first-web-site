        <h2>A Whale of a Tea Party</h2>

    <p>Once upon a time, there was a whale named Whale.</p>
    <p>Whale lived near Tiny Island. Tiny Island had one palm tree, one mango tree, and lots of rocks.
      <br>Tiny Island was surrounded by water, all alone. Whale was alone too. But she wasn't lonely.</p>
    <p>Whale had friends on Tiny Island, Lumpu, Bob, and Grumpy Gus. Whale's friends were always there for her, no matter what.
      <br>One day Whale invited her friends to <a href="https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/A-Whale-of-a-Tea-Party/Erica-S-Perl/Whale-Quail-Snail/9781534497290" target="_blank" title="Buy this book">a tea party.</a> She set out her picnic blanket, and everyone gathered around.</p> 
    <p>Whale made some sand dollar cookies. They were a big hit. "More tea?" asked Whale. "Lumpo...? Bob...? Grumpy Gus...?"
      <br>Whale sighed sadly. It was nice to have friends. But sometimes she wished she had at least one friend who wasn't a rock.</p>
    <p>When the cookies were all gone, Whale went to make some more. It ended up taking quite a while</p>
    <p>When Whale finally returned, something was different. Lumpo was on his side. Bob was upside down. And someone was standing on Grumpy Gus. A new someone!</p>
    <p>"Hi, I'm Quail," the someone said. "Are you new here too?" Whale shook her head. "Is this a good Island for exploring?" asked Quail. "Uhhh," said Whale, unsure.
      <br>"That's okay. I will go find out!" said Quail. Whale watched as Quail explored Tiny Island.</p>
    <p>"Look! This rock has a crack in it," said Quail. "That's his mouth," said Whale. "Rocks don'tn have mouths," said Quail. 
      <br>"Grumpy Gus does. See?" Whale said, and showed Quail his frown. 
      <br>"Lumpo has hair," said Whale. "And Bob is just Bob." Quail laughed and bounced away to explore some more.</p>
    <p>"You're probably too busy exploring to come to my tea party," called Whale. Quail turned and bounced back. "I'm never too busy for tea!" she said.
      <br>Whale grinned. Having a friend who was not a rock was already better than she hoped it would be.</p>
    <p>Just then, Whale noticed something. It looked like a rock. A rock ridinga wave... and heading straight for the party!"
      <br>"Hit the deck!" she yelled.</p>
    <p>CRASH! Whale opened her eyes. "Oh no!" wailed Whale. "That rock ruined everything!" The rock stared back, then it spoke.
      <br>"Who are you calling a rock? The name's Snail. See?" Snail said, giving Whale their card.</p>
    <p>"We thought you were a rock," said Quail. "I get that a lot," said Snail. "What is all this?" "It's a tea party," said Quail. 
      <br>"A party for me?" said Snail. "That's more like it!" "Actually, it's for my friends." said Whale.
      <br>"Friends? What friends?" asked Snail, looking around. "The ones you knocked over!" yelled Whale.</p>
    <p>Snail hid in their shell. "I messed everything up," Snail said, "It's okay, Snail," said Quail. "Really?" asked Snail. "Really?" asked Whale.
      <br>"It was an accident," said Quail. "Want to stay for tea?" Snail peeked back out and nodded. So while Quail showed Snail the island, Whale poured a cup of tea for Snail.</p>
    <p>"Where did you get these awesome cookies?" asked Snail. "I made them," said Whale. "Wow!" said Snail. "Got any more? Surfing works up quite an appetite."
      <br>Whale nodded proudly. "I'm glad you invited me to your tea party," Quail said. "Me too," said Whale.</p>
    <p>"I'm glad I'm not a rock!" said Snail, eating more cookies. "Rocks can't surf, and they can't eat." Whale laughed. She loved having tea parties, and she loved having friends. 
      <br>Old friends who would always be there for her and two new friends who were not rocks.</p>
    <p>"Best day ever!" said Snail. Whale and her friends all agreed.</p>
