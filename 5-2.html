    <p><a href="https://www.barefootbooks.com/hanas-hundreds-of-hijabs" target="_blank" title="Buy this book">Hana has hundreds of hijabs.</a> She collects them wherever she goes, from secondhand shops and shopping malls, to her cousins' closets and online sales. 
        <br>She even upcycles her mama's old skirts!</p>
    <p>Her drawers are overflowing with accessories too - sparkling, glmmering, beaded. She's found her prized pieces among her grandmother's jewels and at Aunty Huda's hair salon, where she helps out after school. 
        <br>Her hijab is always styled magnificently... but aside from having more hijabs than she can possibly wear, she has one peculiar problem. 
    <p>Once Hana places the first jewel, knot or layer on her hijab, she cannot stop! Her fingers flow with talent, decorating to be fancier and more flamboyant. 
        <br>This means she is often overdressed - with exquisite attention to detail, often late - hijab styling does take time, and her hijabs often take over the entire house.</p>
    <p>She tries limiting herself to only one style but she can never stick to it!</p>
    <p>She tries packing her jewels away, but still finds a way to make everything hijab-able. She donates some... but still has more than she can manage. 
        <br>She's still tempted to keep styling. Hana is an artist and her hijab is her canvas.</p>
    <p>Her friends have no ideas to help her - only questions. Hana is their go-to creativity consultant and her hijabs with joy, just like her.</p>
    <p>Her teacher is usually encouraging. But Hana knows that the more time she has, the more styling she can do. Hana loves her hijab. 
        <br>She knows it's important and she feels special when she wears it, just like so many strong women she admires, especially Mama. Her mama loves to watch Hana style her hijab. 
    <p>While Hana helps out at Aunty Huda's salon, she observes carefully. The customers always love their new hairstyles. Hana hatches a hijab-tastic idea.</p>
    <p>Hana hauls her hijab supplies over to Aunty Huda's salon. Boxes full of jewels and rhinestones are stacked like a tower. A rainbow of fabrics flows over the sides. 
        <br>Her collection practically glows from the pavement. She crafts a sign - covered in jewels, of course - and puts it outside. </p> 
    <p>When word gets out, Hana can't keep up with demand.</p>
    <p>Now Hana can share her vibrant collection of hijabs and gems. Helping others is great for her creatiity. And she makes sure she's on time for her customers, who are perfectly styled and terrifically on trend. 
        <br>As people exit the salon after Hana's sparkly styling service, they wear an equally sparkly smile on their faces. And Hana is happiest of all.</p>
