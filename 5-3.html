    <p>On a hot and sunny morning, under lovely clear blue skies, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Worrysaurus-Rachel-Bright/dp/1408356139" target="_blank" title="Buy this book">A little Worrysaurus</a> was opening his eyse.</p>
    <p>He brushed his tiny pointy teeth, then washed his top and tail. He packed a little bag of snacks and set off on a trail. 
        <br>He skipped along with happy legs, across the golden sand, and thought about the day that he had plotted, sketched, and planned.</p>
    <p>A lovely yummy picnic, a delicious summer spread. Worrysaurus liked it when he knew what lay ahead.</p>
    <p>But he hadn't gotten far, you see, it hadn't been that long, before his busy head dreamed up some things that might go wrong. 
        <br>Had he made enough to eat today? And brought enough to drink? This Worrysaurus often was a one to overthink.</p>
    <p>"What if I get lost?" he thought, "Or trip and have a fall?" His happy legs were slowing to a snuffly, shuffly crawl. 
        <br>Worrysaurus liked it when he felt he was prepared. Unexpected happenings... they made him feel quite scared. So when... </p>
    <p>...suddenly from nowhere, a lizard skittered by, shouting in a squeaky yelp and pointing at the sky: "I think a storm is coming! I heard it's on its way!"
        <br>Well, that really put a cloud above his Worrysaurus day.</p>
    <p>"A storm?" said Worrysaurus, "When it's so dry and hot and sunny?" But the news became a butterfly that flittered in his tummy. 
        <br>"I'm not ready for the rain," he said. "I haven't got my wellies!" His teeth began to chatter and his knees - they turned to jellies.
        <br>And all the while, the sky was blue! The sun it shone and shone. But now his lovely picnic thoughts were definitely gone.</p>
    <p>Should he find a cave to shelter? Or run back home and hide? His little worry butterfly grew very strong inside.</p>
    <p>But then he thought of something that his mommy liked to say: "Oh, my little Worrysaurus, chase that butterfly away! 
        <br>Don't you worry now, my lovely, you must try not to fret. If it's not a happy ending, then it hasn't ended yet."</p>
    <p>So he reached into his bag just then, find a little tin. It helped himm with his worries - it had happy things wihtin. 
        <br>A special stick, his Teddy Ned, a pebble, and a letter. And he held them one by one... so everything felt better.</p>
    <p>Then he put away his tin and all the worries in his head...  Freed his little butterfly for happy thoughts instead. 
        <br>"I'll stand up tall. I can be strong. I'll chase my fears away! All is good and all is well and everything's OK."</p>
    <p>And with those little wordlings he calmed his busy brain. Since when the sun is shining, why worry it will rain?</p>
    <p>So he shared his little picnic with the lizard in the sun, and they laughed at all their worrying and really had some fun. 
        <br>Since when you're in the moment, there's no need to run or hide. And then the only butterflies will be the ones outside.</p>
