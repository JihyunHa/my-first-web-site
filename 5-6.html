        <h2>Full Moon</h2>
        <p>word by <strong>Camilla Pintonato </strong></p>
        <img src="fullmoon.jpg" width="10%">
    <p>In the quiet forest, the rabbits hids, eagerly waiting for the sun to set.</p>
    <p>One sticks out its little nose. Is it dark yet?</p>
    <p>Five little gray rabbits hop out of their burrow and set out on a journey into the night. Where are they going?</p>
    <p>What are they carrying in their backpacks? Something round, bright, and beautiful.</p>
    <p>In their secret workshop, the rabbits are very busy! What are they making?</p>
    <p>Eagerly waiting for th moon to rise, the little gray rabbits print, cut, and stack, preparing for a celebration.</p>
    <p>Now what are they carrying in their backpacks? A drawing, a letter, an invitation?</p>
    <p>Feathered friends, please join us! There is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Full-Moon-Camilla-Pintonato/dp/1616899999" target="_blank" title="Buy this book">a full moon</a> tonight!</p>

    <p>Soon the moon is high in the sky!</p>
    <p>The guests follow the rabbits through the forest to gather together underneath the stars.</p>
    <p>The rabbits show them where to sit for the big surprise. Places! Wait! Ready? Go!</p>
    <p>As the birds begin to sing, the lanterns lift up into the sky.</p>
    <p>The little gray rabbits and their friends are dazzled by the light.</p>
    <p>Before their eyes, the full moon shines bright. The paper lanterns sparkle like stars.</p>
    <p>When the show is over, the creatures scurry home to dream of the moon and the stars and th lanterns setting the night sky aglow.</p>
    <p>The full moon sets and gives way to the sun.</p>
    <p>And in their cozy burrow, the little gray rabbits have hidden themselves once again, awaiting the next full moon celebration.</p>
