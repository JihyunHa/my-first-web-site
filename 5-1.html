    <p><a href="https://us.macmillan.com/books/9780374389529/brownisbeautiful" target="_blank" title="Buy this book">Brown is beautiful.</a> A wild mustang in a vast expanse. Shimmering mane calling for a second glance. Tiny ants lifting a weight. Rumbling train transporting freight.</p>
    <p>Brown is stable. Twisted roots tunneling deep. Through wind and rain, the tree will keep.</p>
    <p>Brown is nurturing. Kindling logs fueling a hungry fire. Dark soil helping plants grow higher.</p>
    <p>Brown is brave. Mother bear protecting her young. Countless heroes, all unsung.</p>
    <p>Brown is soaring. A mountain reaching for the sky. An eagle, wings stretched up high.</p>
    <p>Brown is kind. A crooked hollow, home to a bird. A sheepdog watching over its herd.</p>
    <p>Brown is wise. A wrinkled maple leaf that's seen. Spring, winter, and in between.</p>
    <p>Brown is wonder. A stretch of canyon, ever so grand. Stripes and swirls,as if painted by hand.</p>
    <p>Brown is curious. A tiny beak peeking in a ravine. A winding path, its end unseen.</p>
    <p>Brown is inspiring. A raft defying churning waves. Nature's art decorating caves. </p>
    <p>Brown is love. A cozy nest woven with care. Good news for the family to share.</p>
    <p>Brown is potential. A new life crying out. A warm seed about to sprout. </p>
    <p>Brown is beautiful.</p>
    <p>Brown is me.</p>
